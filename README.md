## Howdy there! ðŸ‘‹
This is a fun project that I'm creating inspired by the orignal Adventure Quest by Artix. 

I started creating this project because I wanted to have some fun with front-end coding so I decided to make another game in which is inspired by an game back in my younger days.

## What can you do? ðŸ¤”
As if now, the user can:

- Have popups when pressing on Magic, Items, Equipment, Pet/Companion buttons
- Hover over both the player or enemy stat health, mana, and sp bar area to show their stats
- You can change the action bar skin by pressing on the S button
- Image switching your character when equipping gear in your equipment popup
- Popup auto closes when you press on a button in that popup

## Features ðŸ˜Ž
Some other cool visual effects:

- Button hover shade
- Button Click light-up
- Equipped gear will be shown
